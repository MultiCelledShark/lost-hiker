name: "Lost Hiker – Echo Tag Awareness & Forest Weirdness (Advanced Flavor)"

description: |
  Deepen Echo's awareness of the player's modular race configuration
  (body_type, flavor_tags, size, archetype) and her role as a
  commentator on the Forest's strange, non-physical rules:
    - body shapes that shouldn't exist,
    - swallowing that shouldn't be possible,
    - synths, oozes, fungi, and hybrids the Forest has nevertheless adopted.

  This is an advanced flavor pass on Echo ONLY. No mechanical changes.

goals:
  - Body-type-specific commentary:
      - Expand Echo's dialogue to include:
          - rare, insightful comments about:
              - taur bodies,
              - naga bodies,
              - quadruped forms,
              - humanoid forms when combined with unusual tags (slimy, chitinous, synthetic).
      - Integrate these into:
          - early camp scenes,
          - radio chatter,
          - some belly shelter scenes.

  - Tag family awareness:
      - Fungal / Mycelial:
          - Echo remarks on:
              - earth-rich scent,
              - spores clinging to her scales,
              - sense of being watched by the ground itself through the player.
      - Slime / Ooze:
          - Echo comments on:
              - slipperiness,
              - how it feels to coil around or swallow such a form,
              - needing to adjust grip.
      - Synth:
          - Echo is intrigued but not hostile:
              - “You’re warm, but not like flesh. The Forest accepted you anyway.”
              - comments on resonant hums, harmless static, etc.
      - Elemental / Psionic:
          - Emberheart / frostbreath / stormtouched:
              - remarks about warmth, chill, or tingle when coiling or swallowing.
          - mindecho / astral / dreamlinked:
              - remarks about faint impressions, shared dreams, or mental echoes.

  - Size-magic commentary:
      - Add explicit but low-frequency lines where Echo:
          - acknowledges that predator/prey size logic "shouldn't work",
          - reaffirms that:
              - "The Forest stretches bellies to fit its stories.",
              - "Size means little in here; the Forest decides who carries whom."
      - Use when:
          - predator size < prey size (player or creature),
          - or when the player as pred swallows something obviously bigger by size tag.

  - Belly-flavor expansions:
      - For Echo specifically:
          - Use body_type + tags to adjust how being inside her feels:
              - slime/ooze characters spreading more evenly,
              - fungal characters feeling the Forest more vividly,
              - synth characters feeling vibrations and resonance differently,
              - quadrupeds curling vs nagas coiling inside.
      - Keep Act I non-lethal, gentle, and mostly cozy/intimate survival.

deliverables:
  - Updated Echo dialogue resources:
      - general conversation,
      - radio lines,
      - belly/shelter scenes,
      - small forest-logic monologues.
  - Any small helper addition needed for:
      - checking tag families and size relationships for Echo's lines.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Echo:
      - occasionally references body_type in a way that matches the player's form.
      - occasionally references fungal/ooze/synth/elemental/psionic/material tags.
      - clearly reinforces, at least once, that:
          - the Forest bends size and belly-space in non-physical ways.
  - Belly scenes with Echo:
      - feel more tailored and evocative when using unusual bodies (ooze, fungal, synth, etc.).
      - remain non-lethal, non-gory, and aligned with Act I tone.
  - No new mechanics are added; behavior remains the same.

non_goals:
  - No new questlines.
  - No changes to swallow chances or mechanics.
  - No pred/prey system overhaul.

context:
  - docs/design/Lost_Hiker_Design.md

coding_guidelines:
  - Keep Echo's voice consistent: dry, amused, protective, a bit strange.
  - Do not overuse tag-driven lines; keep them as occasional delights.

test_plan:
  - Create a variety of characters:
      - taur, naga, quadruped, humanoid with:
          - fungal tags,
          - ooze tags,
          - synth tags,
          - elemental and psionic tags.
  - Trigger:
      - early Echo camp conversations,
      - radio chatter,
      - belly shelter.
  - Verify:
      - Echo occasionally comments on form and tags,
      - Echo explicitly mentions Forest size-weirdness at least once per relevant run,
      - generic lines still appear when tag-based ones do not.
