name: "Lost Hiker – Forest Forageables Expansion (Fauna + Magical Ecology)"

description: |
  Expand the Forest's forageable roster with additional small fauna (fish,
  insects, small mammals) and magical/ecological gatherables. The goal is
  to:
    - support the hunger/food economy,
    - feed into tea brewing, rituals, and runestone repair,
    - enrich Astrin, Naiad, Druid, and Fisherman interactions,
    - make different landmarks and biomes feel distinct and rewarding.

  This task is content-only: no new systems, only new data entries and
  small integration with existing foraging and crafting hooks.

goals:
  - Add new aquatic forageables (fish/crustaceans):
      - Creek Darter:
          - small, fast fish in shallow creeks and side-pools,
          - 1 meal of food,
          - may provide minor crafting item (delicate scales).
      - Stoneback Trout:
          - larger, slower river fish, more common at deeper pools,
          - 2–3 meals of food,
          - synergizes with Lizard-Folk Fisherman quests.
      - Silt Crab:
          - small crab in muddy banks,
          - 1 meal of meat plus chitin scrap for future crafting.

  - Add new insects/grubs:
      - Barkgrub:
          - common larva in rotting logs and stumps,
          - low-value but reliable food,
          - better cooked than raw.
      - Glow-Tail Larva:
          - larval form of Glow-Moths,
          - faintly luminous,
          - poor food, but high-value ingredient for Astrin/Druid teas.
      - Moss-Eater Beetle:
          - slow beetle near mossy logs and boulders,
          - 1 meal of food,
          - yields "moss resin" or similar crafting ingredient.

  - Add new small ground forageable mammal:
      - Tangle-Mice:
          - small mice with vine-like tails,
          - found near dense underbrush and tangle-rooted areas,
          - caught in small groups (2–4),
          - each provides 1 meal and occasional "tanglefiber" for basic snares.

  - Add core magical/ecological forageables (Wave 1 set):
      - Burrow-Puff Spores:
          - puffball fungi near cave-mouths and rotting logs,
          - raw: mild nausea or debuff,
          - cooked/processed: calming or aggression-reducing teas,
          - Druid and cave lore tie-in.
      - Ember-Root Bulbs:
          - warm, glowing root bulbs near ley-line fractures,
          - used for stamina/heat teas and in runestone repair mixes.
      - Wisp-Petal Blossoms:
          - tiny shimmering petals found where wisps gather at night,
          - used to boost Forest Memory or clarity teas,
          - Naiad and Astrin can both reference them.
      - Dreammilk Moss:
          - pale glowing moss on logs/stone,
          - boiled: soothing sleep / recovery tea,
          - raw: mild sleepiness debuff.
      - Heartmore Shoot:
          - rare red-tipped shoots that boost stamina recovery,
          - high-tier herb for Astrin,
          - sometimes found near runestones.
      - Starlace Fungus:
          - small fungi appearing only at night under clear skies,
          - used for navigation clarity teas,
          - Druid night rituals can mention/consume them.
      - Veilgrass Tufts:
          - soft gray grass near mystical landmarks,
          - burned as incense or used in calming teas/rituals,
          - flavor text: "forest hush" effect.
      - Glow-Sap Resin Nodules:
          - sap nodules on trees frequented by Glow-Elk and other
            mystical fauna,
          - used for early snare/trap crafting and runestone cement mixes,
          - burns bright when needed as a light source.

  - Forage table integration:
      - Update Forest foraging tables so:
          - different landmarks and depths have distinct foraging profiles.
          - creek/river landmarks:
              - higher chance for Creek Darter, Stoneback Trout, Silt Crab,
                plus Mud-Veil Leech/Loom-Jaw scenery.
          - cave-mouth and rocky landmarks:
              - Burrow-Puff Spores, Barkgrub, Glow-Tail Larva, Starlace Fungus.
          - mystical landmarks (Birch Circle, Sunken Spring, etc.):
              - Wisp-Petal Blossoms, Veilgrass Tufts, Dreammilk Moss,
                Glow-Sap Resin.
          - generic forest floor:
              - Barkgrub, Moss-Eater Beetle, Tangle-Mice, mushrooms.

  - NPC integration hooks (lightweight):
      - Astrin:
          - treat Heartmore Shoot, Dreammilk Moss, Glow-Tail Larva,
            Starlace Fungus, Veilgrass Tufts as high-interest ingredients.
      - Naiad:
          - care about fish (Creek Darter, Stoneback Trout), Silt Crab,
            Wisp-Petal Blossoms, Ember-Root Bulbs.
      - Druid:
          - care about Burrow-Puff Spores, Starlace Fungus, Glow-Sap Resin,
            Dreammilk Moss.
      - Fisherman:
          - explicitly reference Creek Darter and Stoneback Trout in
            dialogue/quests as appropriate.

      - entries for:
          - Creek Darter
          - Stoneback Trout
          - Silt Crab
          - Barkgrub

          - Starlace Fungus
          - Veilgrass Tufts
          - Glow-Sap Resin Nodules
      - each with:
          - id, name, description,
          - biome/depth/time-of-day/season tags,
          - food value (meals),
          - whether it’s safe raw or requires cooking,
          - any crafting/tea tags (e.g. herb_calming, nav_clarity, runestone_mix).
  - data/foraging_forest.json (or equivalent):
      - updated foraging tables tying landmark/biome to spawn chances
        for the new forageables.
  - data/dialogue_npcs_forest.json:
      - minor updates so Astrin, Naiad, Druid, and Fisherman can mention
        or react to the new forageables where it enhances micro-quests.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Foraging at:
      - generic forest landmarks yields a mix of small animals, grubs,
        and a few magical plants.
      - creek/river landmarks yields fish/crabs plus some magical herbs.
      - mystical landmarks yields a higher proportion of magical plants.
      - cave-mouth-adjacent spots yield more fungi/spores.
  - Hunger system:
      - has more gradations of food quality:
          - low-value but common (Barkgrub, Moss-Eater Beetle),
          - medium (rabbit, fish),
          - high-value or hybrid (Stoneback Trout, Ember-Root tea).
  - NPCs:
      - can recognize a subset of these forageables in their micro-quests
        or dialogue without complex new systems.
  - No new mechanics required; everything plugs into existing foraging
    and item handling systems.

non_goals:
  - No new cooking UI or complex alchemy system.
  - No new quest systems beyond the existing micro-quest flags.
  - No Act II-specific forageables.

context:
  - docs/design/Lost_Hiker_Design.md

coding_guidelines:
  - Keep forageables data-driven and consistent.
  - Tag items clearly for future crafting/tea systems.

test_plan:
  - Start a new run and:
      - forage in shallow forest,
      - forage at creek landmarks,
      - forage near cave-mouths,
      - visit mystical landmarks at day and night.
  - Verify that:
      - the new forageables appear in logical places,
      - food values feel reasonable relative to hunger/stamina needs,
      - magical items are uncommon but not impossible to find,
      - Astrin/Naiad/Druid/Fisherman references to these items make sense.
  - Confirm no crashes from missing ids or invalid foraging tables.
