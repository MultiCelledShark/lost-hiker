name: "Lost Hiker – Forest Act I Flavor Polish (Text-Only)"

description: |
  Perform a holistic, text-only polish pass over Forest Act I content:
    - make descriptions clearer, more evocative, and more consistent,
    - trim repetition,
    - fix awkward phrasing/typos,
    - keep tone and content aligned with the design doc.

  IMPORTANT:
    - Do NOT change mechanics, logic, or balance.
    - Do NOT add or remove game systems.
    - Do NOT change numerical values, timers, or probabilities.
    - Only edit strings and simple text templates.

  Focus scope:
    - Forest exploration messages,
    - landmark descriptions,
    - Forest creature encounter text,
    - Belly Phase 1 text (hostile + friendly, including Echo),
    - race-aware flavor lines (NPCs, exploration, foraging, belly),
    - tea and brewing descriptions (including Astrin’s lines),
    - Kirin fast-travel text and Wisp/Slug/Moss-Mare descriptions.

goals:
  - Consistent tone and voice:
      - Ensure narrative tone across Forest Act I is:
          - grounded, slightly eerie, and gently cozy,
          - consistent with the design doc’s “mystical wilderness survival” feel.
      - Remove jarringly modern slang or jokes that break immersion.
      - Align Echo, Astrin, Druid, Naiad, and Fisherman voices with their
        intended personalities.

  - Remove repetition and clutter:
      - Identify description strings that repeat the same phrasing too often
        (e.g. reused belly lines, overused “you feel…” intros).
      - Reword or rotate these lines so repeated events feel fresh without
        altering the underlying meaning.
      - Keep descriptions short enough to be readable in curses, but still
        flavorful.

  - Clarify Forest landmarks and encounters:
      - For Forest landmarks (Glade, creek landmarks, Birch Circle, Sunken
        Spring, cave-mouth edges, fallen giant, etc.):
          - Make sure each has a distinct “hook” line that’s easy to remember.
          - Clarify spatial hints (e.g. “deeper than before”, “near the creek”)
            without adding map mechanics.
      - For creature encounters:
          - Ensure first-encounter text clearly conveys:
              - rough size,
              - temperament (hostile, wary, mystical, friendly-shelter),
              - what’s happening when belly outcomes trigger.
          - Avoid making any predator sound lethally gorey; keep it tense but
            non-graphic, consistent with non-lethal Act I vore rules.

  - Belly Phase 1 polish:
      - Review belly descriptions for:
          - Echo (safe shelter),
          - hostile predators (transport or shelter),
          - friendly bellies (Moss-Treader, Glow-Elk, Wisp-Hive Slug, Moss-Mare).
      - Ensure:
          - no digestion, gore, or lethal implications in Act I,
          - sensory detail is consistent with each creature’s biology and vibe,
          - race-aware variants feel like tasteful variations, not spam.
      - Trim or rewrite any lines that:
          - contradict the “non-lethal belly” contract in Act I,
          - feel redundant or clunky.

  - Race-aware flavor alignment:
      - Check race-based lines for:
          - consistency with race descriptions (from races.json),
          - no direct mechanical promises (e.g. “you see better,” “you’re faster”),
          - no contradicting the “no stat bonuses” rule.
      - Smooth any lines that feel mean-spirited out of character; teasing is
        allowed, but NPCs should remain broadly sympathetic.

  - Tea & brewing flavor:
      - Make sure tea descriptions:
          - clearly communicate general effect category (calming, stamina, clarity,
            warmth, mystical) in flavor text,
          - add race-aware overlays sparingly and smoothly,
          - match Astrin’s persona (practical, plant-savvy, mildly playful).
      - Remove redundant “this is tea” wording and focus on how it feels.

  - Kirin, Wisp-Hive Slug, Moss-Mare & other mystical:
      - Ensure:
          - Kirin’s fast-travel text is clear and readable, explains what the
            player is choosing without a lore-dump.
          - Wisp-Hive Slug and Moss-Mare feel gentle, weird, and safe in Act I.
          - Wisps, Glow-Elk, and other mysticals share a coherent magical “language.”

  - Spelling, grammar, and punctuation:
      - Fix obvious typos.
      - Normalize quotation marks and ellipsis usage.
      - Keep sentences readable in a terminal-sized text box.

deliverables:
  - Updated data/dialogue_*.json for:
      - Echo (only if needed beyond the Echo patch task),
      - Astrin,
      - Druid,
      - Fisherman,
      - Naiad,
      - other Forest Act I NPCs as needed.
  - Updated Forest text resources:
      - landmark descriptions,
      - exploration messages,
      - encounter descriptions,
      - belly text templates,
      - race-aware exploration and foraging strings.
  - Updated tea/brewing text:
      - tea item descriptions,
      - brewing messages,
      - Astrin’s tea-related dialogue.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Forest Act I feels:
      - tonally consistent,
      - less repetitive,
      - clearer in spatial/environmental hints,
      - flavorful but not verbose.
  - All belly descriptions:
      - match non-lethal vore rules for Act I,
      - are internally consistent with each creature’s profile,
      - play nicely with race-aware variants.
  - No mechanics, numerics, or logic are changed:
      - no timing, no stamina/hunger values, no encounter odds.
  - No new systems or UI are introduced.

non_goals:
  - No new quests, creatures, teas, or mechanics.
  - No expansion into Act II zones.
  - No combat changes.

context:
  - docs/design/Lost_Hiker_Design.md

coding_guidelines:
  - Do not touch code branches that change gameplay behavior.
  - Keep changes limited to string content and small template adjustments.
  - Avoid “purple prose”; favor clear, precise imagery.

test_plan:
  - Play through a fresh Forest Act I run:
      - from waking in the Glade,
      - through exploration, first encounters, belly events,
      - through at least one Echo shelter night,
      - interacting with Astrin, Druid, Fisherman, Naiad,
      - drinking a few teas and using basic Forest fast-travel.
  - Confirm:
      - descriptions feel consistent and improved,
      - no text references abilities the player doesn’t mechanically have,
      - no regressions or crashes due to missing string keys.
