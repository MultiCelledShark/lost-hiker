name: "Lost Hiker – Tea & Brew Flavor (Race-Aware, No Mechanics)"

description: |
  Enrich tea and brew descriptions with race-aware flavor text, without
  introducing any mechanical differences. Integrate with existing and
  planned teas (Dreammilk Moss, Ember-Root, Heartmore, Starlace, etc.)
  and with Astrin’s brewing and related NPC commentary.

goals:
  - Identify core tea/brew types:
      - calming/sleep teas:
          - e.g. Dreammilk Moss, Veilgrass-based blends.
      - stamina/energy teas:
          - e.g. Ember-Root Bulbs, Heartmore Shoot.
      - clarity/navigation teas:
          - e.g. Starlace Fungus, Wisp-Petal Blossoms.
      - warmth/comfort teas:
          - e.g. Ember-Root + Glow-Sap combinations.
      - mystical/attunement teas:
          - e.g. rare herbs (later Echo-Leaf, etc.).

  - Add race-aware flavor overlays:
      - For each race, define short, reusable “how tea feels” snippets.
        Examples:
          - elf:
              - teas feel “crisper” and “botanical”; “you feel the forest
                breathing with you.”
          - dwarf:
              - teas feel “earthy, grounding”; “solid warmth spreads
                through your limbs.”
          - lizard_folk:
              - warm teas feel especially blissful; “heat seeps into
                stiff scales.”
          - cow_kin:
              - descriptions emphasize steady, filling comfort.
          - wolf_kin:
              - sharper aromatic notes; “herbs hit your senses like fresh
                winter air.”
          - deer_kin:
              - teas feel calming, heart-slowing; “your pulse settles into
                a forest rhythm.”
          - fox_kin:
              - a little tingle/spark; “your tongue tingles with mischief.”
          - gryphon_folk:
              - airy, bright; “steam curls around your beak; feathers fluff.”
          - dragonborn:
              - teas play off internal warmth; “the brew awakens something
                glowing inside you.”
      - Implement this as:
          - a small helper that takes (base_tea_effect, race_flavor_tags)
            and appends a short, race-specific sentence.

  - Integrate with Astrin’s brewing:
      - When Astrin serves a tea or comments on it:
          - allow her to make occasional race-aware remarks, e.g.:
              - to dragonborn: “This one plays nicely with your inner fire.”
              - to dwarf: “Grounding, isn’t it?”
              - to elf: “Fine-tuned for forest ears and hearts.”
      - Only a few lines needed; keep it light.

  - Keep all differences purely cosmetic:
      - No numerical differences in stamina, hunger, buffs, etc.
      - Only text and “feel.”

deliverables:
  - Updated tea/brew description logic:
      - functions or data that:
          - define base tea descriptions by type,
          - optionally append race-specific flavor sentences.
  - Updated Astrin dialogue:
      - a handful of lines that reference races in the context of brews.

acceptance_criteria:
  - When drinking teas:
      - the player sometimes sees race-aware flavor lines (“how it feels”
        for their body), but base descriptions remain.
      - there are no mechanical differences; buffs and effects remain
        identical across races.
  - Astrin:
      - occasionally comments on teas in a race-aware way that fits her
        personality and doesn’t spam the player.
  - No crashes if race_id is unknown; generic tea descriptions still work.

non_goals:
  - No new teas or mechanical effects.
  - No new UI or brewing systems.

context:
  - docs/design/Lost_Hiker_Design.md

coding_guidelines:
  - Keep tea flavor overlays small and modular.
  - Use race flavor_tags rather than hard-coding all race_ids where possible.

test_plan:
  - Create characters of multiple races and:
      - drink different types of teas (calming, stamina, clarity, warmth).
      - confirm that race-aware flavor lines appear sometimes and that
        base descriptions still make sense.
      - talk to Astrin about brews to see occasional race-aware comments.
  - Confirm that no mechanical stats differ between races; only text.
