# Lost Hiker – Design Doc 0.1 “Discordant Forest”

---

## 1. Overview

### Premise

You wake up half-burned and disoriented inside a charred portal tree in a strange forest that is slightly out of phase with itself. The runestone grid that once stabilized the area is fractured, your HT radio is damaged, and the only thing between you and getting hopelessly lost is a cautious truce with the local wildlife—especially Echo, a radio-attuned serpent who adopts you, and Astrin Tarrinae, a prickly herbalist whose teas tug on the same currents that warped the world.

### Tone & Themes

- **Cozy survival, not grimdark**  
  - The forest is dangerous, but the tone leans toward wonder, gentleness, and emotional recovery.
- **Magical ecology**  
  - Runestones, strange weather, and creatures are all facets of one big weird system, not random gamey nonsense.
- **Rapport and intimacy**  
  - Relationships (Echo, Astrin, others) are as important as tools and stats.
- **Optional vore**  
  - Vore is a **toggleable content mode**:
    - When **off**: encounters emphasize survival, shelter, and emotional intimacy without swallowing.
    - When **on**: belly shelter, cuddly digestion-adjacent scenes, and “give in / feel” paths are available.
- **Hard boundaries**
  - No sexual explicitness.
  - No graphic gore or fetish gore.
  - No underage characters in vore or intimacy content.
  - No non-consensual vore framed as “romantic”; fear/uncertainty is okay, betrayal/abuse is not.

### Scope of v0.1 – “Discordant Forest”

- **Codename meaning**
  - “Discordant Forest” is the **codename for v0.1**, not a separate zone. v0.1 is entirely within the **Forest**.

- **Geographic scope**
  - **Included:**
    - Ashen Hollow (start).
    - Glade hub.
    - Forest paths and clearings within the Forest zone.
    - Forest runestone sites.
  - **Excluded (flavor-only):**
    - Plains, River, Lake, Mountains, Caves, Island Town, Underground Caverns, etc.
    - These may be mentioned via descriptions or blocked exits but are **not explorable** in v0.1.

- **Narrative focus**
  - Forest Act I only, centered on:
    - Waking in the Ashen Hollow / burned portal tree.
    - Reaching and learning to use the **Glade** as a hub.
    - Exploring Forest landmarks under a stamina/time budget.
    - Completing the **runestone repair quest** for Forest Act I.
    - Building early relationships with **Echo** and **Astrin Tarrinae**.

---

## 2. Core Loop & Structure

### Daily Loop

The core v0.1 day loop:

> **Wake → Glade → Explore Forest → Return / Camp → Day Summary**

- Wake in **Ashen Hollow** or Glade-adjacent rest state.
- Visit the **Glade** for:
  - Echo interactions (rest, hints, comfort).
  - Early access to Astrin (once met).
  - Brewing/cooking, crafting (e.g., primitive mortar).
- Choose a **Forest landmark route** and explore until:
  - Stamina runs low.
  - Time-of-day and danger ramps up.
- Decide to:
  - **Return to Glade**, or  
  - **Make camp** at a landmark.
- End-of-day summary:
  - Stamina and hunger recap.
  - Key events.
  - Rapport shifts.
  - Runestone progress.

### Systems Active in v0.1

All of the following are intended to be **live systems** in v0.1 (many already implemented):

- **Hunger & Hydration**
  - Tick down with time and actions.
  - Ignoring them increases penalties (reduced stamina, riskier encounters, mood text).
- **Stamina**
  - Each exploration step and encounter action consumes stamina.
  - Regenerated by rest (camp, Glade, Echo, some teas).
  - Low stamina increases chance of collapse and failure outcomes.
- **Temperature / Cold (lightweight)**
  - Present as a modifier, especially at night and in certain landmarks.
  - In v0.1, mostly expressed via text and mild stamina penalties.
- **Time-of-day & Day/Night**
  - Discrete phases: **dawn, day, dusk, night**.
  - Actions advance time, changing:
    - Encounter tables.
    - Descriptions and ambient events.
- **Seasons (basic)**
  - Season is a global state affecting:
    - Descriptions (foliage, sky, animal behavior hints).
    - Border theming (see UI).
  - In v0.1, seasons are mostly cosmetic with only soft mechanical impact.
- **HT Radio (v1 → v2)**
  - v1: glitchy, impressionistic; used as a flavor/tutorial channel.
  - v2 (after Echo upgrade): clearer dialogue, more specific guidance for runestones and navigation.
- **Save/Load**
  - Persistent player state:
    - Location, time, day/season.
    - Hunger, stamina, flags, runestone progress.
    - Vore toggle and player-as-pred preferences.

### Failure & Recovery

- “Failure” is framed as:
  - **Exhaustion, getting overwhelmed, or being gently overpowered**, not just death.
- Outcomes include:
  - Collapsing and waking at camp/Glade.
  - Being rescued/contained (e.g., Echo’s belly shelter).
  - Losing some progress or resources, not full reset.
- Design goal:
  - Encourage **retreat and recovery** (Glade, Echo, camp, Astrin’s teas) as a normal and emotionally supportive part of the loop.

---

## 3. Forest Act I – Content

### 3.1 Zone Structure

#### Forest Layout Philosophy

- The Forest in v0.1 is:
  - **Hub-and-spokes plus depth**:
    - Glade as central hub.
    - Trails leading to themed landmarks at varying depths.
  - **Stamina-gated depth**:
    - Deeper landmarks require more stamina and/or runestone progress.
  - **Runestone & relationship driven**:
    - Certain paths and events only stabilize/appear after runestone repair and rapport thresholds.

- Movement is **landmark-based**, not free-grid:
  - You move between known locations (landmarks, clearings) with abstracted steps.
  - Each “step” can fire forage, encounter, hazard, or flavor events.

#### Forest Landmarks in v0.1

Approximately **12 Forest landmarks** are currently implemented; the long-term target is **12–14** for v0.1. Some key ones (names may be tweaked to exactly match the data):

- **Ashen Hollow**  
  - Start location; burned portal tree, ash-covered ground, lingering magic static.
- **The Glade**  
  - Safe central hub; Echo’s primary location; Astrin and other NPCs appear here.
- **Forest Path / Edgewood Trail**  
  - Transitional zone between Ashen Hollow and Glade; early low-depth encounters and foraging.
- **Whispering Hollow**  
  - Quiet, slightly uncanny depression where whispers and memory-echoes are strong.
- **Fallen Giant**  
  - Massive fallen tree; common trigger site for special encounters (e.g., Kirin first glimpse).
- **Old Rope Bridge**  
  - Rickety bridge over a ravine; hazard + traversal landmark; future gate to other zones.
- **Glow Elk Clearing / Convergence**  
  - Clearing where Glow Elk gather; key to taming events and navigation hints.
- **Runestone Sites (x3)**  
  - Three fractured runestone locations at increasing depths; each tied to a repair puzzle.
- **Dream Fern Grove**  
  - Lush area rich with Dream Fern and other “vision” herbs; used in Act I tea rituals.
- **Streambank / Dock 1 Approach**  
  - Creek-side landmark with a simple dock; foreshadows River/Lake zones but remains Forest-bound.

> **Reality check:** Exact landmark names/count in code take precedence. The design target is **12–14 meaningful landmarks**, with **at least 3 dedicated runestone sites**.

### 3.2 Main Forest Quest (Act I)

#### Goal

Stabilize the Forest by **repairing fractured runestones** that govern resonance, memory, and navigation. Act I is about:

- Discovering the existence and nature of the runestone network.
- Repairing **three runestones** using:
  - Physical repair (mortar).
  - HT radio tuning.
  - Tea-assisted meditation.
- Feeling the forest shift from “discordant” to “slightly less cursed.”

#### Runestone Pipeline – “Breath of the Forest”

Each runestone follows a three-layer repair process:

1. **Discovery & Approach**
   - Triggered by:
     - Exploration at sufficient depth.
     - Echo hints.
     - HT radio glitches.
   - Player can:
     - Inspect runestone.
     - Note fracture pattern.
     - Learn that “something is off.”

2. **Physical Repair – “Restore the Glyph Track”**
   - Craft **primitive mortar** at camp:
     - Gather ash, clay/silt, sand.
     - Use simple crafting/brewing menu to create `primitive_mortar`.
   - At the stone:
     - Commands: `inspect runestone`, `mix mortar`, `apply mortar`, `place fragment`.
   - Race-specific flavor advantages (textual guidance only in v0.1):
     - Elves: sense correct alignment.
     - Dwarves: stabilize edges.
     - Lizard-kin: notice micro-fissures.
     - Cow-kin: enhanced comfort/discomfort intuition.
     - Humans: rely entirely on Echo’s and radio hints.

3. **Resonance Tuning – “Restore the Hum”**
   - Use HT radio **near** the repaired face:
     - Commands: `use radio`, `adjust frequency`, `hold steady`.
   - Feedback:
     - Radio emits tones/static.
     - Echo gives in-radio coaching once rapport and radio version allow it:
       - v1: impressionistic hints.
       - v2: clearer, sentence-level guidance.
   - Success:
     - Stone’s tone shifts from distorted to harmonious.
     - Mortar “sets” in a magical way.

4. **Pulse Realignment – “Restore the Beat”**
   - Requires specific **tea-brewing and meditation**:
     - Brew Dream Fern or similar tea.
     - Drink at the stone.
     - Use a `meditate`-style command.
   - Effects:
     - Short vision or emotional sequence.
     - Runestone’s “heartbeat” syncs with the forest again.

#### Runestone Repair Outcomes

Repairing a runestone:

- Reduces local distortion and hazard weight.
- Lowers stamina cost in that region.
- Improves Echo rapport slightly.
- Improves HT radio clarity.
- Stabilizes NPC routes (more predictable Astrin/Echo/other NPC appearances).
- Encourages Kirin interest (fast travel future hook).
- Unlocks access to deeper Forest routes.

#### Act I Completion Criteria (v0.1)

Minimum criteria for “Forest Act I complete” flag:

- **Three runestones repaired** via full pipeline.
- **Radio upgraded** to v2 with Echo’s help.
- **Kirin foreshadowed** via at least one event (not necessarily fully accessible for travel yet).
- Final Act I summary/day sequence acknowledging:
  - Forest feels less discordant.
  - Exits to other zones are now **thematically ready** but still mechanically blocked.

Anything more dramatic (full zone transition, big boss, full Kirin fast travel) is **future work**.

### 3.3 Encounters & Creatures

#### Target Creature Count (Forest v0.1)

- Target: **≈10 distinct Forest creatures** with authored encounters in v0.1, drawn from the Forest creature pool.

Candidate/core Forest creatures:

- **Red Wolf**
- **Grey Wolf**
- **Timber Wolf**
- **Dire Wolf** (rarer, deeper)
- **Bear (Grizzly)**
- **Coyote**
- **Boar**
- **Giant Centipede** (rare, hints at underground)
- **Glow Elk** (neutral → tamable)
- **Dragon-Wolf** (special intelligent predator with belly-interaction twist)
- (Plus **Echo**, handled as NPC, not generic encounter)

> Actual implemented set in code takes precedence. The v0.1 bar is at least ~10 creatures with full encounters.

#### Encounter Types

- **Threat encounters**
  - Wolves, boar, bear, centipede, etc.
  - Drive stamina loss, risk, and survival decisions.
- **Neutral / skittish**
  - Deer, Glow Elk, some birds.
  - Foraging, observation, low-stakes tension.
- **Curious / predatory but tamable**
  - Glow Elk, Dragon-Wolf, Kirin glimpses (later).
- **Rapport/vore-enabled**
  - Certain predators shift into **“Feel / Escape / Give Up”** verb trees when:
    - Vore is on.
    - Rapport or narrative conditions are met.
  - Echo is the flagship example; others may follow in future versions.

#### Season/Time/Depth Effects

In v0.1:

- **Depth**
  - Shallow: mostly low-threat, foraging, early wolves/coyotes.
  - Mid-depth: more boar, bear, and centipede chances; Glow Elk more common at certain clearings.
  - Deep: rarer predators (Dire Wolf, Dragon-Wolf), key runestones.
- **Time-of-day**
  - Night: higher predator weighting, lower visibility, more eerie/whisper events.
  - Dawn/dusk: transitional behaviors (howling, migrations, Glow Elk gatherings).
- **Season**
  - Primarily affects description; can gently nudge encounter weights.
  - Full mechanical weather system (rain, storms, etc.) is **deferred**.

### 3.4 Side Quests & Micro-Events

Examples of small content in v0.1:

- **Dream Fern Visions**
  - Micro-quest around discovering Dream Fern, brewing it, and experiencing vision scenes that hint at the runestone grid and future zones.
- **Glow Elk Follows**
  - Events where a Glow Elk appears repeatedly and, if followed, leads to:
    - Safer routes.
    - Runestone sites.
    - Kirin-adjacent triggers.
- **Blue Fireflies / Sky Phenomena (micro-events)**
  - Atmospheric sequences at certain landmarks tying into runestone distortions.
- **HT Radio Glitches**
  - Short “mystery signals” that foreshadow distant zones or future NPCs.

Planned small multi-step quests (at least one of these should land in v0.1):

- A **herb-gathering mini-quest** for Astrin (find specific plants near multiple landmarks).
- A **Glade repair/comfort quest** tied to Echo (help clean, decorate, or ward the Glade).

---

## 4. NPCs

### 4.1 Echo

**Role in Story**

- First major NPC, encountered at or near the **Glade**.
- Emotional anchor:
  - Represents safety, reassurance, and a non-judgmental presence.
- Long-term, Echo is the **Forest guardian** tied to both runestones and the HT radio.

**Mechanical Role**

- **Rest & Shelter**
  - Belly shelter as a **safe rest option**:
    - Warm, protective place to recover stamina and recover emotionally.
  - Glade-based rest and conversation.
- **Tutor & Guide**
  - Explains:
    - Basic survival loop (don’t overextend, manage stamina).
    - Runestones and local dangers.
    - HT radio function and later upgrades.
  - Provides **situational coaching**, reacting to:
    - Over-fighting or over-fleeing.
    - Ignoring hunger/stamina.
    - Repeated failures at certain landmarks.
- **Radio Upgrade**
  - Swallows/attunes the HT radio in a key scene.
  - Unlocks v2 with clearer dialogue and more specific hints.

**Vore/Cozy Behavior in v0.1**

- Focus is on **safe, comfort vore**:
  - Shelter after a bad day.
  - Protective containment during storms/night (future).
- Any more intense or risky vore is **future work**, not required for v0.1.

**Rapport & Reactions**

- Echo has a **rapport score** that affects:
  - Tone (from cautious to affectionate).
  - How often belly shelter is offered.
  - Depth of personal conversations.
- High rapport:
  - More intimate dialogue.
  - Additional hints and safety nets.
  - More willingness to “bend the rules” for the player.

### 4.2 Astrin Tarrinae

**Identity**

- **Astrin Tarrinae** is the canonical herbalist/tea NPC of the Forest.
- Earlier name “Tannirae” refers to the same character; use Astrin Tarrinae going forward.

**Role in Story**

- Highly knowledgeable, initially prickly herbalist/tea maker.
- Specializes in:
  - Plant lore.
  - Teas that affect mood, stamina, perception, and resonance.
- Over time, becomes a **conditional cozy presence**:
  - Someone you can sit with by the fire and process the weirdness.

**Rapport-Driven Arc**

- **Low Rapport**
  - Curt, clinical, purely functional.
  - Offers identification and basic advice, possibly for a cost.
- **Mid Rapport**

    - Invites/joins for **camp-at-the-Glade** evenings.
    - Freely shares good teas.
    - Has reflective, vulnerable conversations.
  - Eligible for shared “comfort in danger” scenes.

**Tea & Experimentation**

- Teas provide:
  - Mild buffs (stamina, focus, warmth).
  - Mood shifts (calm, courage).
  - Rare side effects (visions, odd sensory distortions) that are fun, not run-breaking.
- As rapport increases:
  - More potent or unusual blends become available.
  - Astrin may ask for feedback on experimental mixes.

**Camp & Cozy Scenes**

- At high rapport and with the right conditions:
  - Astrin appears at night-time Glade camps.
  - Scenes focused on:
    - Shared tea.
    - Talking about the day’s events.
    - Processing fear, failure, and small victories.

Mechanical relevance:

- Micro-quests (fetch, warnings, small rituals).
- Flavor and lore for future zones.
- Some may serve as **dev preset targets** in Dev Mode.

---

## 5. Systems

### 5.1 Survival (Hunger, Stamina, Rest)

**Hunger & Hydration**

- Values decay over the day.
- Penalties:
  - Reduced stamina max.
  - Increased stumble/collapse chances.
  - More depressive or frazzled narration.

**Stamina**

- Core currency of exploration and encounters.
- Spent by:
  - Landmark traversal.
  - Fight / Freeze / Flee / Feel / Escape / Give-Up actions.
- Restored by:
  - Camping.
  - Glade sleep.
  - Echo belly shelter.
  - Certain teas/foods.

**Rest Options**

  - Cozy camp scenes near/with Astrin at high rapport.

### 5.2 Time, Day/Night & Seasons

- **Time-of-Day**
  - Discrete phases: dawn, day, dusk, night.
  - Each action advances time; some actions consume more.
  - Night:
    - Higher predator chances.
    - Stronger temperature penalties.
- **Day Count**
  - Tracks macro progression; certain events (e.g., runestone triggers, Kirin interest) might depend on minimum day count.
- **Seasons**
  - Represented as:
    - Visual/textural changes.
    - UI border theme shifts.
  - v0.1: Minimal mechanical changes; full weather system deferred.

### 5.3 Travel & Fast Travel

**Standard Travel**

- **Landmark-to-landmark movement**:
  - Each move costs stamina and time.
  - Depth tiers increase cost and risk.

**Fast Travel in Act I**

- Systems present but underused in current code:
  - **Wayfinding teas** (enhanced navigation).
  - **Kirin** (mythic travel creature).
- v0.1 target:
  - At least one **limited fast travel option** unlocks late in Act I:
    - Example: Kirin rides between Glade and one deep landmark.
- Early-mid Act I should still feel **mostly on foot**.

**Zone Exits**

- Landmarks that thematically point toward:
  - Plains, Mountains, River, Cave, etc.
- In v0.1:
  - These exits are **blocked but visible**.
  - Provide flavor, foreshadowing, and future hooks.

### 5.4 Vore System

**Toggles**

- Global **vore ON/OFF** setting:
  - Configured at character creation and adjustable in settings (with warning).
- **Player-as-pred** options:
  - Separate preference stored in game state.
  - v0.1 mostly focuses on player-as-prey and cozy shelter; player-as-pred content is limited.

**Content Boundaries**

- Optional; easily disabled.
- No graphic digestion, no gore.
- Strongly consent-focused, especially for recurring NPCs.
- Framed primarily as:
  - Shelter.
  - Comfort.
  - Strange intimacy.

**Encounter Integration**

- Two philosophical branches:
  - **Fight / Freeze / Flee** – baseline survival verbs.
  - **Feel / Escape / Give-Up** – available when:
    - Vore is ON.
    - Creature and scene support it.
    - Rapport/context conditions are met.
- Echo is the primary v0.1 showcase for this dual-system behavior.

**Bellied Mode Environment**

- Entering a belly is an **environmental shift**, not just a flag:
  - UI border softens/changes color.
  - Interior drips and ambient descriptions change.
  - Sound/feel described via text and HT/Echo commentary.
- Mechanical effects:
  - Generally acts as rest with small trade-offs.
  - Some scenes may offer unique insight or hints.

### 5.5 HT Radio

**HT Basics**

- Damaged radio the player already owns at start.
- v1:
  - Distorted, impressionistic phrases.
  - Used to:
    - Hint at Echo.
    - Glitch near runestones.
    - Provide atmospheric weirdness.
- v2:
  - Unlocked via Echo’s radio-swallow/attunement scene.
  - Provides:
    - Clearer dialogue.
    - More precise hints for:
      - Runestone tuning.
      - Navigation.
      - NPC appearances.

**Narrative Role**

- Primary diegetic channel for:
  - Mysterious world hints.
  - Distant voices (future NPCs/zones).
- Serves as a “voice in your ear” tutorial system that stays in-universe.

### 5.6 Dev Mode

Dev Mode is a **developer/tester-only** configuration, not exposed as a normal player feature.

**Activation**

- Enabled via environment variable or config (e.g. `DEV_MODE=1`).

**Dev Lab**

- Additional **start menu** entry when Dev Mode is ON.
- Workflow:
  1. Select from ~15 **preset characters** (JSON-defined).
  2. Select a **target**:
     - Zone/landmark (Forest areas only in v0.1).
     - Specific encounter/NPC (e.g. Echo first meeting, runestone, Astrin tea scene).
  3. Spawn into the world with that preset and starting state.

**Save Isolation**

- Dev Mode saves:
  - Stored separately.
  - Do **not** appear in the normal `Continue` menu.
- Prevents test runs from polluting player saves.

**Dev Commands API**

- In Dev Mode, a command namespace provides:
  - Teleport to landmarks.
  - Set hunger/stamina/time.
  - Toggle flags (runestone repaired, rapport levels).
  - Force encounters/events.
  - Reload JSON data.

**Optional Debug Console**

- Soft target for later:
  - In-game console via key (e.g., `~` or `F2`).
  - REPL-like commands for power users.

---

## 6. Curses UI & UX (0.1)

### Screen Layout & Requirements

- **Minimum terminal size:** `100×30`.  
  - 80×24 is **not supported**; descriptions and panels won’t fit.
- **Static multi-window layout:**
  - **Outer two-cell border** (themed/animated).
  - **Status bar** (top or top-adjacent).
  - **Narrative window** (large central pane).
  - **Menu / side window** (right or left column).
  - **Input bar** (bottom line).
- Layout is **fixed**:
  - No moving windows between frames.
  - No whole-screen scrolling or `stdscr.clear()` in normal updates.
  - Only individual windows redraw.

### Menu Behavior

- **Scrollable menus**:
  - Up/Down: move cursor within visible options.
  - Left/Right: page through long lists.
- No one-option pages:
  - Always show a meaningful chunk of options when possible.
- Menu scrolling only redraws the **menu window**, not the whole screen.

### BorderTheme System

- **Two-cell-wide frame** around the entire UI:
  - Drawn by a centralized `BorderTheme` system.
- Border appearance (characters + colors) depends on:
  - **Season** (spring/summer/autumn/winter).
  - **Danger state** (safe, tense, high-danger).
  - **Bellied state** (outside vs inside).

**Phase Rollout (for implementation safety):**

1. **Phase 1 – Static Borders**
   - Simple, season-aware borders. No animation.
2. **Phase 2 – Border Drips**
   - Slow drips or small flourishes in the border **only**.
   - Used for:
     - Weather-like hints (rain, icicles).
     - Danger emphasis (red flickers).
3. **Phase 3 – Bellied Interior Drips**
   - Only active in **bellied mode**.
   - Creature-specific appearances and movement.

### Drip Constraints

- **Border drips:**
  - Confined strictly to the **outer two-cell border zone**.
  - Never overwrite:
    - Menu highlights.
    - Input prompts.
    - Core narrative text.
- **Interior drips:**
  - Only in bellied scenes.
  - Themed per predator (color, pattern).
  - May vary by individual (see palettes).

### Internal Palette & Variants

- Each creature can have one or more **internal palettes** (color sets).
- For most predators:
  - First belly encounter with that individual **rolls and assigns** a palette.
  - Palette is saved per-individual and reused in all later bellied scenes.
- Some magical/chaotic predators (if enabled) may:
  - Re-roll palettes per encounter (species-level rule).
- **Rare variants:**
  - Low-probability “shiny” internal palettes (e.g., 1-in-20) for surprise.
- Named NPCs (Echo, unique future preds):
  - Have fixed palettes, rolled once or explicitly defined.

### Input & Navigation

- Single-key navigation:
  - Arrows / `hjkl` for movement in menus.
  - Enter/Space to confirm.
  - Esc/`q` to back out.
- Consistent, visible key hints where appropriate.

### Accessibility & Readability

- Constraints:
  - No color combinations that make text unreadable on typical terminals.
  - Animations must be subtle enough not to obscure text.
- Options (future-leaning but good to keep in mind):
  - Low-animation mode (disable drips).
  - High contrast theme.

### Title Screen

- v0.1 goal (soft):
  - ASCII-art **Lost Hiker** logo.
  - Simple campsite-themed art.
  - Centered main menu (`New Game / Continue / Settings / Quit`).

### Dev/Debug Overlay (Soft)

- In Dev Mode, optional overlay panel can show:
  - Current zone/landmark.
  - Time, day, season.
  - Stamina, hunger, temperature.
  - Active flags (runestones, rapport, vore state).
  - Last few commands.

---

## 7. Constraints & Content Boundaries

### Hard Content Constraints (v0.1)

- No explicit sexual content.
- No graphic gore or fetish violence.
- No underage characters in any intimate/vore context.
- Vore content:
  - Optional, clearly configurable.
  - Framed as shelter/intimacy, not torture.
- Emotional tone:
  - Danger and fear are allowed.
  - The emotional landing zone is **comfort and resilience**, not despair.

### Technical & Structural Constraints

- **Terminal-only, curses-based UI**:
  - No mouse, no graphics beyond text/ASCII.
- **No jittery screen clears**:
  - Avoid `stdscr.clear()` and full-screen scrolling for regular updates.
- **JSON-driven content**:
  - Items, races, creatures, events, teas, etc. must live in JSON.
  - Engine avoids hard-coded one-off data, except where absolutely necessary.
- **Dev Mode isolation**:
  - Dev saves and commands must never affect regular saves.
  - Dev commands disabled in critical narrative sequences by default.

### NPC & Scene Constraints

- All major scenes (Echo, Astrin, others) must:
  - Respect rapport and flags.
  - Be anchored to actual zones/landmarks and times of day.
- No “floating” scenes that ignore where the player is or what they’ve done.

---

## 8. Open Questions & Future Work

### Unresolved Design Questions for v0.1

- **Landmarks**
  - Final Forest landmark count:
    - Do we ship with **12** or bump to **14**?
  - Which names/locations are actually in data vs still theoretical?
- **Astrin’s Depth in v0.1**
  - Is she:
    - Mostly a tea/testing NPC?
    - Or do we ship at least one or two full **camp-at-Glade** scenes?
  - Minimum required Astrin content for 0.1 vs “nice to have.”
- **Echo Scene Count**
  - How many unique cozy/vore scenes land in 0.1?
  - Where to draw the line between “Act I baseline” and “later act” content.
- **Act I Beat Structure**
  - Exact ordering and gating of:
    - Ashen Hollow intro.
    - Glade arrival.
    - First Echo belly shelter.
    - First runestone.
    - Radio upgrade.
    - Kirin foreshadow event.
- **Dev Mode Details**
  - JSON schema for dev presets:
    - How granular should initial conditions be?
  - Do we implement the in-game debug console (`~`/`F2`) for 0.1 or defer?
- **Weather System**
  - Do we introduce:
    - Basic weather states (clear, drizzle, storm)?
    - Mechanical effects (stamina, visibility)?
  - Or keep weather purely descriptive until 0.2+?
- **Bellied Drip Mechanics**
  - Strictly cosmetic or minor mechanical differences (calming vs agitating interiors)?
  - How many palette/drip variants per species are worth doing for 0.1?
- **Legendary Internal Palettes**
  - Do a few predators (or Echo specifically) get **unique, lore-significant** internal palettes?
- **Border Themes by Biome (Post-0.1)**
  - For now, borders respond to season/danger/belly.
  - Later: per-biome variants when new zones open?

### Post-0.1 Ideas (Beyond “Discordant Forest”)

These are **explicitly out of scope** for v0.1 but shape direction:

- Opening the **Plains** with dinosaur encounters and larger escorts.
- **River/Lake** boating, orcas/eels, waterfall pool beasts.
- **Mountains** and the elder dragon.
- **Island town** with NPC networks, economy, and social hub.
- **Underground caverns** with centipede hives and deeper magic.
- Full **weather and climate** systems affecting all zones.
- Expanded co-vore and multi-pred scenes with more complex mechanics.

This document should be treated as the **single source of truth for v0.1 “Discordant Forest”**. When code, JSON, and this doc disagree, the intended hierarchy is:

1. **Code reality** (what actually runs)  
2. **This design doc** (what 0.1 should converge toward)  
3. **Old master doc & future plans** (post-0.1 roadmap)

Updates to the code or scope should be reflected here as the project evolves.
